## Books Read in March 2025
1. The Hero's Journey

## Unifying cultural themes

I recently discovered Joseph Campbell's work at a local bookstore, and soon after reading [The Hero's Journey](https://www.jcf.org/learn/joseph-campbell-heros-journey) I've become increasingly interested in better understanding the stories that bind each culture together. Campbell seems to have a gift of being able to articulate what motivates (and frustrates) each individual on their quest to find purpose and union in life. No doubt his work has left an indelible imprint on the fabric of Western culture over the last 50 years.
