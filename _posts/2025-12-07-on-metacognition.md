## In the woods

Back in the mid-1800s, [Thoreau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau) accurately predicted an ingredient of the good life largely missing in the 21st century: intentional stillness and solitude. [Walden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden) documents his time in the Massachusetts woods at Walden Pond, including day-to-day reflections and observations of the scenery nearby. One thing in this book particularly stood out to me: Thoreau was exceptionally well versed in both interoception (internal awareness) and exteroception (external awareness), and he took great joy in identifying the creatures around his abode. In my experience, these two skills can be improved through deliberate practice, but in the age of countless digital attractions, it's likely harder to become comfortable with them than in times past.

## Who was right?

In the mid-20th century, George Orwell and Aldous Huxley had an exchange of letters in which they debated whose dystopian novel would most accurately predict the society of the future. After reading both Orwell's [1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four) and Huxley's [Brave New World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World), I'm now convinced elements of both stories are partially accurate, as both authoritarianism and despondency are both on the [rise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism#cite_note-WhatEveryoneNeedstoKnow-180) globally. In this sense, Huxley's vision of a future where people are entertained into cultural oblivion is much like a precursor to Neil Postman's [Amusing Ourselves to Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death). If you enjoy reading dystopians, Brave New World is one you shouldn't miss.

## A stroll through insanity

[The Eden Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eden_Express) characterizes a gradual descent into insanity, courtesy of Mark Vonnegut, the son of the famous novelist Kurt Vonnegut. In this memoir, Mark offers readers a personal account of his experience with schizophrenia and the events leading up to it. What's more, he does so while connecting with his readers through his use of vivid imagery and a surreal style of humor. Even if you are just a tiny bit curious what his experience was like, this book will not disappoint.

## Strong ground

I don't think it's a stretch to say that Nassim Taleb's notion of antifragility can also be extended to one's sense of self, especially given what Internal Family Systems (IFS) therapy has begun to teach us about the myths and harms of the predominant [mono-mindset](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2646686593). In this light, [Ryan Holiday's](https://ryanholiday.net/) book [Ego is the Enemy](https://egoistheenemy.com/) takes on a new light: learning to communicate with your manager (or protector) parts rather than shaming or shutting them down can be an effective tool for navigating difficulty or high-expectation periods of life. This may not have been the takeaway Holiday had in mind for his readers, but it's certainly one I took from this title.
