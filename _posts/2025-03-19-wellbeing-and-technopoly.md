## Quite amusing all things considered

Neil Postman's [Amusing Ourselves to Death](https://www.amazon.com/Amusing-Ourselves-Death-Discourse-Business/dp/014303653X) is a classic critique of television and its impact on public discourse. In it, he argues that the medium of television (translation: modern social media) has transformed serious discourse into entertainment, leading to a society more concerned with amusement than with critical thought.

## The science of human attachment

A canonical work, [Attached](https://www.amazon.com/Attached-Science-Adult-Attachment-YouFind/dp/1585429139) by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller explores the science of adult attachment styles and how they affect our relationships. The book provides insights into how understanding your own attachment style can lead to healthier, more fulfilling relationships.

## Technocracy to technopoly

Neil Postman's [Technopoly](https://www.amazon.com/Technopoly-Surrender-Technology-Neil-Postman/dp/0679745408) is a thought-provoking examination of how technology has come to dominate our culture. Postman argues that we have surrendered our autonomy to technology, allowing it to dictate the terms of our lives. He warns against the dangers of a society that prioritizes technological advancement over human values and ethics.

## Love with fewer limits

bell hooks' [All About Love](https://www.amazon.com/All-About-Love-New-Visions/dp/0060959479) is a demanding yet profound exploration of love in its many forms. In this work, Hooks challenges the conventional notions of love, urging us to redefine it as a practice of mutual respect, care, and understanding directed toward one's growth.

## Why we are disconnected

Jonathan Haidt's popular title [The Anxious Generation](https://www.anxiousgeneration.com/book) paints a bleak picture of what happens when we humans unwittingly rewire childhood norms for an entire generation of kids (i.e., Gen Z or iGen). Without mindful design behind our use of technology early on, Haidt shows how we begin building the basis of a society riddled with distrust and social isolation. Fortunately, Haidt offers many practical next steps for how to correct this social trend with intention-based social and technology engagement.

## The pursuit of wellbeing

Lastly for this month, [Wellbeing](https://www.amazon.com/Wellbeing-Essential-Elements-Tom-Rath/dp/1595620400) by Tom Rath and Jim Harter provides a comprehensive look at the elements that contribute to one's overall wellbeing. The authors argue that wellbeing is not just the absence of illness but a holistic state that encompasses (1) career, (2) social, (3) financial, (4) physical, and (5) community wellbeing (in order of the magnitude of effect on one's overall wellbeing). Importantly, the authors provide practical strategies for enhancing wellbeing in our lives.
