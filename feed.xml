One thing in this book particularly stood out to me: Thoreau was exceptionally well versed in both interoception (internal awareness) and exteroception (external awareness), and he took great joy in identifying the creatures around his abode. In my experience, these two skills can be improved through deliberate practice, but in the age of countless digital attractions, it’s likely harder to become comfortable with them than in times past.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/12_2025/walden-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/12_2025/walden-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/12_2025/walden-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/12_2025/walden.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="who-was-right">Who was right?</h2> <p>In the mid-20th century, George Orwell and Aldous Huxley had an exchange of letters in which they debated whose dystopian novel would most accurately predict the society of the future.

In this sense, Huxley’s vision of a future where people are entertained into cultural oblivion is much like a precursor to Neil Postman’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death">Amusing Ourselves to Death</a>.

But who said the books you read have to be homogeneous in topic or philosophy? I certainly don’t subscribe to that ideology, as you can probably already tell.</p> <h2 id="books-read-in-october-2025">Books Read in October 2025</h2> <ol> <li>Leonardo da Vinci</li> <li>Play It Away</li> <li>I’m Glad My Mom Died</li> <li>Tools of Titans</li> </ol> <h2 id="polymathic-peops-pronounced-peeps">Polymathic peops (pronounced “peeps”)</h2> <p>I’ve read many other titles by Walter Isaacson before, yet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci_(Isaacson_book)">this one</a> stands out as the most detailed (even sometimes <em>literal</em>) dissection of the interests of one of history’s greatest polymaths. If you can say one thing with certainty about Leonardo (of Vinci), it’s that he knew what he was curious about and was relentless in his pursuit of knowledge and the necessary skills to satisfy those curiosities. I think this latter point is important to emphasize, because it is a pattern we can all emulate to some degree in our lives: identifying tasks we are good at and for which we would enjoy honing our skills further. Perhaps not coincidentally, this idea ties right into Cal Newport’s discussion of “knowledge work” in <em>So Good They Can’t Ignore You</em> and <em>Slow Productivity</em>. But I think it’s also worth noting that Leonardo, as a true artist <em>and</em> scientist, sometimes was interested in a topic for the sake of discovery and nothing else. To me, that’s a trait that’s also something worth importing into our everyday lives, with a true Leonardo-style litmus test: “Can you describe the tongue of a woodpecker”?</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2025/leonardo-da-vinci-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2025/leonardo-da-vinci-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2025/leonardo-da-vinci-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2025/leonardo-da-vinci.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="working-for-works-sake">Working for work’s sake</h2> <p>Charlie Hoehn and Tim Ferriss have written extensively on the topic of burnout and working for work’s sake (WFWS), which is often a precondition to burnout.

Environments shape habits, which in turn can make us more or less likely to care for our long-term needs such as strong social connections with others and a sense of purpose in one’s life. In this book, Charlie shares several personal accounts of having to rebuild his personal and professional life with intentionality after “auto-piloting” through life following unsustainable work habits.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2025/play-it-away-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2025/play-it-away-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2025/play-it-away-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2025/play-it-away.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="sobering-stories-of-childhood-abuse">Sobering stories of childhood abuse</h2> <p>Jennette McCurdy’s memoir <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Glad_My_Mom_Died">I’m Glad My Mom Died</a> is a difficult read, though not necessarily in a negative sense. Simply, the topics it explores are deeply personal yet widely applicable, making it a rare example of a memoir that zooms in on a particular season in one’s life yet repeatedly raises existential (and often hilarious) questions we can all wrestle with lifelong. You can be sure of one thing after finishing this book: the mechanics of childhood matter. In the moment, we can all normalize the contexts we find ourselves in early on, yet it often takes time and new experiences for introspection to take place to help us decide which life practices to carry forward and which to revise or leave behind.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2025/im-glad-my-mom-died-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2025/im-glad-my-mom-died-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2025/im-glad-my-mom-died-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2025/im-glad-my-mom-died.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="many-lives-many-lessons">Many lives, many lessons</h2> <p>As a callback to <em>Play It Away</em>, Tim Ferriss’ book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers/dp/1328683788">Tools of Titans</a> serves as both a support and a counterweight to Charlie Hoehn’s writings, in that it provides several case studies of sustainable as well as borderline disfunctional personal and professional routines that have helped others yield unordinary results in business, art, science, and beyond. There are many conflicting “lessons of life” that emerge from this book, but to me this reflects the nonlinearity of life rather than any particular shortcoming of this book. I’d rather a book simply present many of the personal stories of what has worked in the past to create impact, which is what this one does well. However, one reocurring theme that does emerge from the book is the importance of mindfulness. Without it, it’s hard to imagine many of the interviewees would have been able to execute the vision of what they wanted to create.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2025/tools-of-titans-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2025/tools-of-titans-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2025/tools-of-titans-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2025/tools-of-titans.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>Later.</p> <p><strong>Alex</strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Annotated-Readings"/><category term="Biography"/><category term="Work"/><category term="Tools"/><category term="Stories"/><category term="Memoirs"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An annotated reading of the books I finished in October 2025.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Growing with people and plants</title><link href="https://amorehead.github.io/blog/2025/growing-with-people-and-plants/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Growing with people and plants"/><published>2025-10-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://amorehead.github.io/blog/2025/growing-with-people-and-plants</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://amorehead.github.io/blog/2025/growing-with-people-and-plants/"><![CDATA[<div class="l-page"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/10_2025/growing-with-people-and-plants-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/10_2025/growing-with-people-and-plants-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/10_2025/growing-with-people-and-plants-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/10_2025/growing-with-people-and-plants.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>As the weather outside gets colder, this month’s reading selection should warm up our thoughts.</p> <h2 id="books-read-in-september-2025">Books Read in September 2025</h2> <ol> <li>Good to Great</li> <li>How to Change Your Mind</li> <li>Nonviolent Communication</li> </ol> <h2 id="outlasting-your-initial-success">Outlasting your initial success</h2> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_to_Great">Good to Great</a> exemplifies curiosity-driven scientific inquiry into economic patterns.

Maria Bowler, the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Time-Vision-Crafting-Productivity/dp/1540904075">Making Time</a>, claims that this overwhelming cultural focus on productivity/value production over every other aspect of society crowds out the space necessary for one to be a modern creative (in the broadest sense). To recover our (innate) ability to be creative in an increasingly distracted and attentionally crowded landscape, Bowler argues we need a change in perspective and self-identification, understanding that (as creatives) our productivity offers marginal value to the world when our creative drives or inspirations are treated as an optional (and less important) component of the human experience. To be human is to both create and produce, it would seem.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/09_2025/making-time-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/09_2025/making-time-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/09_2025/making-time-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/09_2025/making-time.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="experiential-hooks">Experiential hooks</h2> <p>The history of feminism and women’s rights in the Western world is complex and multi-faceted, and one aspect that often gets overlooked, bell hooks argues in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Everybody-Passionate-bell-hooks/dp/0896086283">Feminism is for Everybody</a>, is that the growth of the women’s empowerment movement can be seen as a net positive for <em>everybody</em>. Simply put, we <em>all</em> benefit when we are <em>all</em> empowered to take ownership of our lives and decisions. For example, restricting men to speak only a limited vocabulary of simplistic emotional experiences (as is common in the West) dampens the quality of life of men as well as women, and women’s empowerment plays a key role in alleviating this burden. As <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11213-009-9164-6">systems research</a> has shown over the last 50 years, feminism and systems theory have more in common than one might initially believe, so if we want to create (there’s that word again) better systems of the future, we had better learn as best as we can from the past.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/09_2025/feminism-is-for-everybody-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/09_2025/feminism-is-for-everybody-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/09_2025/feminism-is-for-everybody-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/09_2025/feminism-is-for-everybody.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="the-grocery-industrial-complex">The grocery industrial complex</h2> <p>Grocery shopping in America can be quite a culture shock for those not familiar. Imagine huge warehouses full of intricately or bulk-packaged products lining each and every marketable space with little room to breathe and all the pressure to checkout sooner rather than later (lest you, heavens forbid, get stuck in a checkout line). How did it get to be this way, how sustainable is it, and why does each grocery chain compete with each other for product selection as fiercely as (American) football teams compete for the Superbowl?

What can be done about this problem? To start with, science needs to begin including women not as an optional (add-on) gender axis to include in study designs but as a foundational dimension of future studies.

In this book, Sheldon Solomon, Jeff Greenberg, and Tom Pyszczynski provide many evidence-based examples of how we humans, in the past and in the 21st century, have developed many (peculiar) behaviors that are triggered by reminders of our mortality. Connecting the “terror management” framework the authors describe in this work with the increasingly relevant discussions in the artificial intelligence community concerning consciousness and agency seems like an important next step for humanity to take, and I believe this book’s authors have done a superb job distilling terror management theory’s main findings into a format most people can easily digest and relate to. If you are interested in peering behind your own layers of consciousness and mortality, give this book a try.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/05_2025/the-worm-at-the-core-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/05_2025/the-worm-at-the-core-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/05_2025/the-worm-at-the-core-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/05_2025/the-worm-at-the-core.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="gut-instinct">Gut instinct</h2> <p>How often do you rely on gut feelings to make important decisions in your life? After reading Malcolm Gladwell’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink:_The_Power_of_Thinking_Without_Thinking">Blink</a>, you might think twice. This book argues for the importance of examining how potent pattern recognition can be for enacting both positive and negative events in society.

But this task isn’t as easy as it may sound: we humans have a history of “defaulting to trust”, which sometimes leads us to completely misread critical situations and the intentions of various historical figures. So should we simply “default to distrust”? Most likely not: just think about how difficult it would be to organize society around this principle. Instead, through this book, Gladwell argues that we should acknowledge the limitations of “truth-defaulting behavior” yet remain optimistic of its cooperation-promoting spirit.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/05_2025/talking-to-strangers-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/05_2025/talking-to-strangers-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/05_2025/talking-to-strangers-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/05_2025/talking-to-strangers.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="a-seaward-novella">A seaward novella</h2> <p>Hemingway’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea">The Old Man and the Sea</a> tells the tale of Santiago and his (long) journey to catch a giant marlin.

This journey of the ego passes through four key ideas presented in <a href="https://www.miguelruiz.com/the-four-agreements/">The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom</a>: the importance of (1) being impeccable with our word, (2) not taking things personally, (3) not making assumptions, and (4) always doing our best.

In this competitive landscape, timing is nearly everything, and being left behind can be detrimental for one’s continued career in science. Moreover, one is often seen as a scientific thought leader for being the first to publicize a novel insight or development, which is likely a positive thing. However, in this post, I would like to challenge readers (and certainly myself) to expand one’s viewpoint on this topic, as the future of science (and life) depends, in part, on how we normalize the pace of our work.</p> <h2 id="slow-carb-science">Slow carb science</h2> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonality">Seasonality</a> is a core component of <a href="https://calnewport.com/my-new-book-slow-productivity/">slow productivity</a>, a rebuttal to the annual trend of increasing the pace of our lives. After the COVID-19 pandemic, many knowledge workers (not only researchers) could identify the impact that full-time remote work had on their sense of personal and professional sustainability. Burnout (an opaquely defined concept, which may be related to a long-term misalignment with one’s values) gripped many individuals and drove them to seek new work arrangements or lifestyles. However, the scientific (work) “treadmill” continued (and continues) to zoom forward. If we are to identify a sustainable means of structuring our work, we must start with the fundamental questions, “What are my values?” and “Am I OK as is?”. If the answer to either is fuzzy, we are most likely treading through our lives with “unstable footing” (as I have often experienced for myself). Moreover, I argue that the nature of the work we choose to do (and ultimately may accomplish) is a function of these values and self-views (e.g., a short-term value system may lead to narrow and uninspired research).</p> <p>It takes tremendous courage and commitment to adopt a <a href="https://teachingcommons.stanford.edu/teaching-guides/foundations-course-design/learning-activities/growth-mindset-and-enhanced-learning">growth mindset</a> not just for our professional lives <em>but also for our relationships and personal development</em>. Part of this growth may include honestly assessing what we want out of life (by way of our value system) and what we are willing to give up for the loved ones in our lives (also part of our value system). In these internal dialogues, it is easy to mistake one of our many <a href="https://ifs-institute.com/">parts</a> for <em>ourselves</em>, which underscores how important it is for us to intentionally bake in an <a href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/how-the-enneagram-system-works/">integration</a> practice into our daily schedules. This has become an essential part of my daily routine, and I recommend those interested in learning more to explore frameworks such as Internal Family Systems or the Enneagram to discover more of what may be waiting to be discovered. As we discover more of our core values and patterns, we can begin to do the hard work of integrating our personalities through relationships and professional commitments built on intentionality and vision.</p> <h2 id="strategic-splurges">Strategic splurges</h2> <p>With deep insights about ourselves and those in our lives, we can start practicing seasonality in all its richness, <a href="https://calnewport.com/deep-work-rules-for-focused-success-in-a-distracted-world/">deeply working</a> with the time we’ve allotted to the task of building <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwOdU02SE0w">career capital</a> and investing in our chosen communities. As in nature, there are times for scurry and times for limited hurry, and the ratio of the two should hopefully be small and predictable (to some degree). In fact, this intrinsic pacing may yield <em>better</em> and faster results in our professional pursuits due to increased clarity (i.e., not fooling ourselves and letting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">gradient descent</a> lead the way). It’s hard to imagine such a trajectory played out in our lives will not impact what kinds of work we choose to spend our limited time on.</p> <p>Cheers.</p> <p><strong>Alex</strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Musings"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Philosophy"/><category term="Inquiry"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A naive musing on the philosophy of scientific research and beyond.]]></summary></entry></feed>
