Citing many examples of well-done (and not so well-done) film scripts, the author Blake Snyder lays out a taxonomy that most commercially successful films have followed when structuring their narratives. Keeping this taxonomy of story types in mind, Snyder then explains how anyone can bolster their storytelling muscles with the help of narrative templates. Overall, this book will be enjoyable to those who are interested in looking behind the scenes of narrative crafting in popular films.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/06_2025/save-the-cat-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/06_2025/save-the-cat-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/06_2025/save-the-cat-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/06_2025/save-the-cat.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="following-great-examples">Following great examples</h2> <p>For the last 30 years, John Maxwell has been writing extensively on the topic of leadership and growth, with <a href="https://store.maxwellleadership.com/products/the-21-irrefutable-laws-of-leadership-25th-anniversary-edition">The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership</a> being a good starting point for his writing.

History presents several instances of moments in time where certain countries were threatened with challenges beyond their ability to cope (at that point in time). Some countries (for certain reasons) stagnated or declined as a result of such challenges, whereas others (for other reasons) improved their average quality of life as a result. In a time of unceasing polarization between groups of thought, Upheaval offers readers a chance to imagine how modern societies may rise to the challenges they are currently facing. As usual, in due time, we will see what social strategies promote adaptation and which accelerate decline.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/06_2025/upheaval-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/06_2025/upheaval-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/06_2025/upheaval-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/06_2025/upheaval.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="identifying-the-source">Identifying the Source</h2> <p>Simply put, please read Rick Rubin’s book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/717356/the-creative-act-by-rick-rubin/">The Creative Act</a>.

In this book, Sheldon Solomon, Jeff Greenberg, and Tom Pyszczynski provide many evidence-based examples of how we humans, in the past and in the 21st century, have developed many (peculiar) behaviors that are triggered by reminders of our mortality. Connecting the “terror management” framework the authors describe in this work with the increasingly relevant discussions in the artificial intelligence community concerning consciousness and agency seems like an important next step for humanity to take, and I believe this book’s authors have done a superb job distilling terror management theory’s main findings into a format most people can easily digest and relate to.

But this task isn’t as easy as it may sound: we humans have a history of “defaulting to trust”, which sometimes leads us to completely misread critical situations and the intentions of various historical figures. So should we simply “default to distrust”? Most likely not: just think about how difficult it would be to organize society around this principle. Instead, through this book, Gladwell argues that we should acknowledge the limitations of “truth-defaulting behavior” yet remain optimistic of its cooperation-promoting spirit.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/05_2025/talking-to-strangers-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/05_2025/talking-to-strangers-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/05_2025/talking-to-strangers-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/05_2025/talking-to-strangers.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="a-seaward-novella">A seaward novella</h2> <p>Hemingway’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea">The Old Man and the Sea</a> tells the tale of Santiago and his (long) journey to catch a giant marlin.

With an “antifragile student” philosophy, however, Lukianoff and Haidt argue that students will be better prepared to face the complexities of the modern world and future technological advancements, by equipping them with the skills necessary to mediate idealogical disagreements with composure and compassion.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/04_2025/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/04_2025/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/04_2025/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/04_2025/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p><strong>Alex</strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Annotated-Readings"/><category term="Creativity"/><category term="Philosophy"/><category term="Myths"/><category term="Wellbeing"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An annotated reading of the books I finished in March 2025.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Wellbeing and technopoly</title><link href="https://amorehead.github.io/blog/2025/wellbeing-and-technopoly/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Wellbeing and technopoly"/><published>2025-03-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://amorehead.github.io/blog/2025/wellbeing-and-technopoly</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://amorehead.github.io/blog/2025/wellbeing-and-technopoly/"><![CDATA[<div class="l-page"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/03_2025/wellbeing-and-technopoly.webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/03_2025/wellbeing-and-technopoly.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>This month’s book selection mixes the themes of wellbeing, love, and technology, with a focus on how they intersect in our lives.</p> <h2 id="books-read-in-februrary-2025">Books Read in Februrary 2025</h2> <ol> <li>Amusing Ourselves to Death</li> <li>Attached</li> <li>Technopoly</li> <li>All About Love</li> <li>The Anxious Generation</li> <li>Wellbeing</li> </ol> <h2 id="quite-amusing-all-things-considered">Quite amusing all things considered</h2> <p>Neil Postman’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amusing-Ourselves-Death-Discourse-Business/dp/014303653X">Amusing Ourselves to Death</a> is a classic critique of television and its impact on public discourse.

In this competitive landscape, timing is nearly everything, and being left behind can be detrimental for one’s continued career in science. Moreover, one is often seen as a scientific thought leader for being the first to publicize a novel insight or development, which is likely a positive thing. However, in this post, I would like to challenge readers (and certainly myself) to expand one’s viewpoint on this topic, as the future of science (and life) depends, in part, on how we normalize the pace of our work.</p> <h2 id="slow-carb-science">Slow carb science</h2> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonality">Seasonality</a> is a core component of <a href="https://calnewport.com/my-new-book-slow-productivity/">slow productivity</a>, a rebuttal to the annual trend of increasing the pace of our lives. After the COVID-19 pandemic, many knowledge workers (not only researchers) could identify the impact that full-time remote work had on their sense of personal and professional sustainability. Burnout (an opaquely defined concept, which may be related to a long-term misalignment with one’s values) gripped many individuals and drove them to seek new work arrangements or lifestyles. However, the scientific (work) “treadmill” continued (and continues) to zoom forward. If we are to identify a sustainable means of structuring our work, we must start with the fundamental questions, “What are my values?” and “Am I OK as is?”. If the answer to either is fuzzy, we are most likely treading through our lives with “unstable footing” (as I have often experienced for myself). Moreover, I argue that the nature of the work we choose to do (and ultimately may accomplish) is a function of these values and self-views (e.g., a short-term value system may lead to narrow and uninspired research).</p> <p>It takes tremendous courage and commitment to adopt a <a href="https://teachingcommons.stanford.edu/teaching-guides/foundations-course-design/learning-activities/growth-mindset-and-enhanced-learning">growth mindset</a> not just for our professional lives <em>but also for our relationships and personal development</em>. Part of this growth may include honestly assessing what we want out of life (by way of our value system) and what we are willing to give up for the loved ones in our lives (also part of our value system). In these internal dialogues, it is easy to mistake one of our many <a href="https://ifs-institute.com/">parts</a> for <em>ourselves</em>, which underscores how important it is for us to intentionally bake in an <a href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/how-the-enneagram-system-works/">integration</a> practice into our daily schedules. This has become an essential part of my daily routine, and I recommend those interested in learning more to explore frameworks such as Internal Family Systems or the Enneagram to discover more of what may be waiting to be discovered. As we discover more of our core values and patterns, we can begin to do the hard work of integrating our personalities through relationships and professional commitments built on intentionality and vision.</p> <h2 id="strategic-splurges">Strategic splurges</h2> <p>With deep insights about ourselves and those in our lives, we can start practicing seasonality in all its richness, <a href="https://calnewport.com/deep-work-rules-for-focused-success-in-a-distracted-world/">deeply working</a> with the time we’ve allotted to the task of building <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwOdU02SE0w">career capital</a> and investing in our chosen communities. As in nature, there are times for scurry and times for limited hurry, and the ratio of the two should hopefully be small and predictable (to some degree). In fact, this intrinsic pacing may yield <em>better</em> and faster results in our professional pursuits due to increased clarity (i.e., not fooling ourselves and letting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">gradient descent</a> lead the way). It’s hard to imagine such a trajectory played out in our lives will not impact what kinds of work we choose to spend our limited time on.</p> <p>Cheers.</p> <p><strong>Alex</strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Musings"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Philosophy"/><category term="Inquiry"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A naive musing on the philosophy of scientific research and beyond.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The principles of tomorrow</title><link href="https://amorehead.github.io/blog/2025/the-principles-of-tomorrow/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The principles of tomorrow"/><published>2025-02-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://amorehead.github.io/blog/2025/the-principles-of-tomorrow</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://amorehead.github.io/blog/2025/the-principles-of-tomorrow/"><![CDATA[<div class="l-page"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/02_2025/the-principles-of-tomorrow-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/02_2025/the-principles-of-tomorrow-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/02_2025/the-principles-of-tomorrow-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/02_2025/the-principles-of-tomorrow.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>What do artificial intelligence, hedge funds, and personality frameworks have in common?

In particular, this book details how its founders intentions of crafting a culture of radical transparency traded the common (comfortable) business practice of “saving face” by withholding one’s true opinions of business decisions for the incredible financial and professional growth the fund has achieved over the last several decades. In short, operating a business from a culture of mutually-assured accountability is far from an easy task, but Bridgewater stands as a case study of the power of this approach to leadership in the world of business and beyond.

The Myers-Briggs framework offers a well-researched pathway to elucidating your personality traits, whereas the Enneagram promotes an intrinsic and somatic approach to self-discovery. Specifically, the Enneagram features nine key personality centers that individuals identify with to varying degrees, and each type typically integrates (or disintegrates) to another type in states of personality “balance” (imbalance). These integration pathways offer Enneagram practitioners a unique way to develop more “balance” in one’s relationships to others and self.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/02_2025/the-sacred-enneagram-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/02_2025/the-sacred-enneagram-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/02_2025/the-sacred-enneagram-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/02_2025/the-sacred-enneagram.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="staying-small">Staying small</h2> <p>Paul Jarvis asks the readers of his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Company-One-Staying-Small-Business/dp/1328972356">Company of One</a> to reconsider one’s definition of success in business.

By definition, such skills are <em>rare</em>, so without intentionality and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)#Deliberate_practice">deliberate practice</a> one is unlikely to (serendipitously) cultivate them.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2024/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2024/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2024/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2024/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="know-thy-biases">Know thy biases</h2> <p>In the spirit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman">Daniel Kahneman</a>, <a href="https://davidrobson.me/">David Robson</a> warns readers of the dangers of relying on <em>intellectual thinking</em> indiscriminately. As Robson explains in <a href="https://davidrobson.me/books/the-intelligence-trap/"><em>The Intelligence Trap</em></a>, human minds are unconsciously prone to taking mental shortcuts and reverting to well-formed biases about how the world (or other people) work. Through countless startling examples of intellectual blindspots leading to social phenomena such as <em>meta-forgetfulness</em>, Robson cautions readers to reconsider the grounding of their well-formed views of how the world <em>really</em> works.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2024/the-intelligence-trap-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2024/the-intelligence-trap-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2024/the-intelligence-trap-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/11_2024/the-intelligence-trap.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>Be kind(er) to yourself and others this month.</p> <p><strong>Alex</strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Annotated-Readings"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Values"/><category term="Passion"/><category term="Skills"/><category term="Biases"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An annotated reading of the books I finished in October 2024.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What doesn’t kill an everything bagel only makes it stronger</title><link href="https://amorehead.github.io/blog/2024/the-antifragile-everything-bagel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What doesn’t kill an everything bagel only makes it stronger"/><published>2024-10-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://amorehead.github.io/blog/2024/the-antifragile-everything-bagel</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://amorehead.github.io/blog/2024/the-antifragile-everything-bagel/"><![CDATA[<div class="l-page"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/10_2024/the-antifragile-everything-bagel-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/10_2024/the-antifragile-everything-bagel-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/10_2024/the-antifragile-everything-bagel-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/10_2024/the-antifragile-everything-bagel.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>For this month’s annotated readings, I’ve decided to combine the months of August and September into a single (everything bagel) post.

How might that impact the psychology and motivations of the story’s protagonists? The series finishes its narrative on a steely note yet in a manner that spurs its readers to consider how else the story might have evolved.
