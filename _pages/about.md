<h4 id="about">About</h4>
Welcome! :wave:<br>

I am a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at the <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://missouri.edu/'>University of Missouri</a>. I work as a graduate research assistant in Dr. Jianlin Cheng's <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='http://calla.rnet.missouri.edu/cheng/'>Bioinformatics & Machine Learning Lab</a>. Prior to my Ph.D., I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at Missouri Western State University. My interests in computer science and machine learning began through many fun experiences building and experimenting with bleeding-edge software early on, and competing in mathematics Olympiads in high school.

<h4 id="about">Research</h4>
My current research interests include machine learning, deep learning, computational biology, and generative modeling. In particular, I have developed new geometric graph neural network architectures such as <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/GCPNet'>GCPNet</a> and the <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/DeepInteract'>Geometric Transformer</a> for modeling biomolecules of various sizes (e.g., proteins), introduced <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/Bio-Diffusion'>GCDM</a> for diffusion generative modeling of 3D molecules, assembled <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/PoseBench'>PoseBench</a>,  the first deep learning benchmark for broadly applicable protein-ligand docking, and released <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/FlowDock'>FlowDock</a>, the first all-atom flow matching model for protein-ligand structure and binding affinity prediction.

<h4 id="about">Writing</h4>
I enjoy sharing thoughts on literature, research, and applications on <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://amorehead.github.io/blog/'>my blog</a>.

<h4 id="about">Education</h4>
Looking to get started with <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://github.com/amorehead/MLForEveryone'>machine learning</a>?
