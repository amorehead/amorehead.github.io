[Internal Family Systems](https://ifs-institute.com/) (IFS) is a blossoming topic in pop psychology today, yet its roots are over 40 years old, thanks to pioneers such as Richard Schwartz. To round out the month of July with a dose of "internal" work, I listened to the introductory IFS audiobook [*No Bad Parts*](https://ifs-institute.com/nobadparts) narrated partially by Schwartz himself. This book challenges many preconceived notions many of us have regarding "mono-mind theory" (i.e., the idea we are of one fixed personality at all times) while introducing readers to a new way of understanding oneself in light of a "family" of interacting personalities, each of different internal ages and (e.g., protective) wants and desires. Those interested in acquiring a new framework for understanding oneself and others may find this introduction to IFS helpful (and perhaps even transformative).
