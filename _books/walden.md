Back in the mid-1800s, [Thoreau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau) accurately predicted an ingredient of the good life largely missing in the 21st century: intentional stillness and solitude. [Walden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden) documents his time in the Massachusetts woods at Walden Pond, including day-to-day reflections and observations of the scenery nearby. One thing in this book particularly stood out to me: Thoreau was exceptionally well versed in both interoception (internal awareness) and exteroception (external awareness), and he took great joy in identifying the creatures around his abode. In my experience, these two skills can be improved through deliberate practice, but in the age of countless digital attractions, it's likely harder to become comfortable with them than in times past.
