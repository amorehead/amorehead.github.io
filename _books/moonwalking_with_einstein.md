Can you memorize a pack of cards in under 10 minutes? 30 minutes? 2 hours? Or perhaps 2 days? If not, you might be an ordinary human being. [Moonwalking with Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonwalking_with_Einstein) documents the stories of a group of (ordinary?) humans who honed their *normal* memory capacities into world-class capabilities. One of their key techniques? [Mnemonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic) and [memory palaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci), which we can all leverage to learn new information. For example, want to learn a new language? [Mnemonics](https://www.wanikani.com/) can save the day here.
