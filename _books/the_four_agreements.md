Don Miguel Ruiz is the first voice of Toltec wisdom I've encountered. Rooted in presence, humility, and introspection, Ruiz opens the door for readers to explore the inner world of the ego, what it's afraid of, and what it needs most to feel "OK". This journey of the ego passes through four key ideas presented in [The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom](https://www.miguelruiz.com/the-four-agreements/): the importance of (1) being impeccable with our word, (2) not taking things personally, (3) not making assumptions, and (4) always doing our best. Presenting the ideas in this order allows readers to observe a natural "stacking" of their successive complementarity, and enables us to access more of an "integrated self" in the process (to use IFS lingo).
