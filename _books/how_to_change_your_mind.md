[Michael Pollan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pollan) is one of my favorite writers, not only for his writing style but also his topic selection. He focuses primarily on issues at the intersection of food, ecosystems, health, and personal growth, and [How to Change Your Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Change_Your_Mind) is no exception. Somewhere near the latter of these two topics, this book raises many important questions about the nature of consciousness and our role in shaping it (with or without exogenous chemicals). After reading it, you'll hopefully be left with a sense that there is still much for us to discover about how we learn from and relate to the environments around us.
