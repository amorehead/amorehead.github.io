Sustainability is a popular topic these days, and not just in science. Economics, in particular, plays a significant role in shaping the direction in which a society moves: towards short-term gains or long-term momentum. Kate Raworth's book [Donut Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doughnut_(economic_model)) offers readers a poignant introduction to the concept of a *doughnut economy*, which provides rich context and discussion points for the coming decades of economic development.
