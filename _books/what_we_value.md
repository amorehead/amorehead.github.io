How does our (neuro)biology inform what we believe and how we act in accordance with those beliefs? And how can we change our beliefs/values if we are not satisfied with the set we are currently working with? Emily Falk explores these questions by synthesizing several research studies, some of which her research lab has led, on the intersection of neuroscience and human behavior and values. If you are curious about which brain regions and mechanisms are (likely) responsible for different short and long-term value calculations we all make (e.g., in everyday as well as extreme planning scenarios), this book will scratch some of that itch. Who knows? Maybe even some of your values might change as a result!
