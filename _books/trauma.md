Paul Conti's recent book [*Trauma: The Invisible Epidemic*](https://drpaulconti.com/) delves into the ubuiquity and effects of traumas (plural), both small and large, over the course of one's life (in especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic). In this book, Conti offers readers some empathetic and actionable insights into more mindful ways of reflecting on past and current traumas and how we as a society should no longer find it acceptable to stigmatize them or consider them "indelible character attributes", to instead find ways of growing alongside them.
