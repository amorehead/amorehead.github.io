A slightly different topic I explored this month is that of childhood adversity and its impact on the trajectory and tenor of one's personal and professional life. A go-to book on this topic, in my view, is [*Supernormal*](https://megjay.com/supernormal/) by Meg Jay. This work explores the character traits and seasonalities of the life of a supernormal individual who has faced above-average difficulties in life, and how such individuals can learn to recognize and adapt their core beliefs about the unique opportunities that their past suffering presents.
