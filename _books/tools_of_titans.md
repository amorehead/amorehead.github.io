As a callback to *Play It Away*, Tim Ferriss' book [Tools of Titans](https://www.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers/dp/1328683788) serves as both a support and a counterweight to Charlie Hoehn's writings, in that it provides several case studies of sustainable as well as borderline disfunctional personal and professional routines that have helped others yield unordinary results in business, art, science, and beyond. There are many conflicting "lessons of life" that emerge from this book, but to me this reflects the nonlinearity of life rather than any particular shortcoming of this book. I'd rather a book simply present many of the personal stories of what has worked in the past to create impact, which is what this one does well. However, one reocurring theme that does emerge from the book is the importance of mindfulness. Without it, it's hard to imagine many of the interviewees would have been able to execute the vision of what they wanted to create.
