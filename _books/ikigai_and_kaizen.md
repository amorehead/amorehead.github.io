As described by Anthony Raymond, [Ikigai and Kaizen](https://www.amazon.com/Ikigai-Kaizen-Professional-procrastinating-productive/dp/B0CN55C4JB) are two Japanese concepts that can help individuals find purpose and meaning in their lives. [Ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai) refers to the intersection of what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. It encourages individuals to pursue their interests while also considering their impact on the world. [Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) translates to "continuous improvement" and emphasizes the importance of small, incremental changes in one's life and work. Together, these concepts can help individuals cultivate a sense of purpose and fulfillment in their personal and professional lives.
