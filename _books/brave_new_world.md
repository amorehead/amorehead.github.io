In the mid-20th century, George Orwell and Aldous Huxley had an exchange of letters in which they debated whose dystopian novel would most accurately predict the society of the future. After reading both Orwell's [1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four) and Huxley's [Brave New World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World), I'm now convinced elements of both stories are partially accurate, as both authoritarianism and despondency are both on the [rise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism#cite_note-WhatEveryoneNeedstoKnow-180) globally. In this sense, Huxley's vision of a future where people are entertained into cultural oblivion is much like a precursor to Neil Postman's [Amusing Ourselves to Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death). If you enjoy reading dystopians, Brave New World is one you shouldn't miss.
