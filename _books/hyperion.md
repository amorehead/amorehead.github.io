This monthly reading list would be remiss without including at least one classic sci-fi book, namely the Hugo award-winning [Hyperion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_(Simmons_novel)). In this first entry of the two-part series, Dan Simmons weaves an intricate web of character arcs and backstories into a singular narrative that compels readers to plow through its pages (or at least it did for me). I will say, I felt the ending of this entry was too abrupt for my taste, but at least the follow-up work picks up almost exactly where the first book concludes. If you like time-altering sci-fi narratives, you should consider adding this series to your reading queue.
