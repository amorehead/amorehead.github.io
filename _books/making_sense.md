Lastly, for the month of September, I journeyed through Sam Harris' popular [*Making Sense*](https://www.samharris.org/podcasts) audiobook, which is organized as a collection of hour-long podcast interviews grouped by complementarity or relevance for modern sociopolitical issues. Although some of the cultural commentary in this audiobook is now a bit dated, its discussions of ideas central to consciousness and intelligence I believe are still useful for navigating the world of today (especially in the public adoption era of large language models).
