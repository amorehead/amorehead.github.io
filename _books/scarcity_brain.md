Michaal Easter answers this key question with a Comfort Crisis follow-up titled [Scarcity Brain](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/705376/scarcity-brain-by-michael-easter/). Using the social psychology framework of a [scarcity mindset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity_(social_psychology)), Easter points out the subtle ways modernity has been engineered to manipulate our internal states of reward, pleasure, and risk tolerance to get us to become increasingly reliant on addictive technologies and products (to our detriment). For those looking for a way to break the cycle, reading this book is a good place to start.
