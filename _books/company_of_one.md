Paul Jarvis asks the readers of his book [Company of One](https://www.amazon.com/Company-One-Staying-Small-Business/dp/1328972356) to reconsider one's definition of success in business. In a world where bigger is often equated with better, Jarvis argues that staying small can be a more sustainable and fulfilling path for many entrepreneurs. He provides practical advice on how to build a business that prioritizes personal values and well-being over growth for growth's sake.
