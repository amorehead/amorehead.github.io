For the last 30 years, John Maxwell has been writing extensively on the topic of leadership and growth, with [The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership](https://store.maxwellleadership.com/products/the-21-irrefutable-laws-of-leadership-25th-anniversary-edition) being a good starting point for his writing. In it, Maxwell enumerates some of the most common archetypes he's observed in many successful institutional leaders to date. As a useful template for understanding what can make or break would-be leaders, Maxwell's 21 leadership laws help one balance the intricacies of growing as an individual alongside one's institution.
