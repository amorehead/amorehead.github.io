I happened upon this book based on an algo's recommendation, and goodness, did it *not* disappoint. At first, I was worried it would read like a dry version of a Planet Earth documentary. Fortunately, the author (Peter Wohlleben) of [The Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate](https://www.peterwohllebenbooks.com/the-hidden-life-of-trees) knows how to ground readers in relation to the world around them. Learning how trees care for each other in parent-child and neighor-neighbor relationships reveals that seemingly simple plants in our everyday surroundings communicate with each other and other (e.g., fungal) species intricately and meticulously to maintain the ecological balance of a habitat.
