Fame, fortune, and fondness meet within Jay Gatsby, a character widely known as [The Great Gatsby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby). Despite all his material wealth, Gatsby inevitably longs for deep human connection and, as a result, surprises the first-person narrator Nick Carraway with his level of friendliness and candor. This story is a classic for a reason: a well-balanced look at an unexamined life leads to compelling conclusions.
