[Good to Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_to_Great) exemplifies curiosity-driven scientific inquiry into economic patterns. If you have found yourself wondering why some companies achieve *longevity velocity* and seemingly revitalize themselves decade over decade while others struggle to live up to their past successes, this book offers some keen hypotheses with data to support them. Despite the age of the book since its first release, its primary principles regarding "level-5 leadership" and "first who, then what" will likely stand the test of time.
