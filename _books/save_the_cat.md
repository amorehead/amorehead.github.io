[Save the Cat!](https://savethecat.com/) is all about storytelling and how to do it well. Citing many examples of well-done (and not so well-done) film scripts, the author Blake Snyder lays out a taxonomy that most commercially successful films have followed when structuring their narratives. Keeping this taxonomy of story types in mind, Snyder then explains how anyone can bolster their storytelling muscles with the help of narrative templates. Overall, this book will be enjoyable to those who are interested in looking behind the scenes of narrative crafting in popular films.
