Lastly for this month, Stephen Mitchell's version of the [Bhagavad Gita](https://www.amazon.com/Bhagavad-Gita-Translation-Stephen-Mitchell/dp/0609810340) showed up on one of my audiobook recommendation lists, so I gave this one a listen. As an ancient text, its interesting to see how many ideas that show up in later philosophies or worldviews are rooted in this work. For those who are interested in expanding their context of world history and idealogy, consider this one for your reading list.
