Hemingway's [The Old Man and the Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea) tells the tale of Santiago and his (long) journey to catch a giant marlin. What starts as an ordinary day of fishing gradually takes a turn for the unexpected when Santiago is faced with reeling in the fish haul of his life. Littered with vivid imagery of the experience of wrestling with nature, The Old Man and the Sea is a delightful novella that all should consider.
