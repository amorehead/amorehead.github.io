Trevor Noah is a gem, especially as a writer and storyteller. He knows how to engage his audiences, whether through humor or brutal (spoken) realities. His perspectives on race, religion, relationships (family and friends), and culture are authentic and on the nose enough to quickly charm readers. This is a classic [find](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_a_Crime) that everyone should enjoy.
