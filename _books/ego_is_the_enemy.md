I don't think it's a stretch to say that Nassim Taleb's notion of antifragility can also be extended to one's sense of self, especially given what Internal Family Systems (IFS) therapy has begun to teach us about the myths and harms of the predominant [mono-mindset](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2646686593). In this light, [Ryan Holiday's](https://ryanholiday.net/) book [Ego is the Enemy](https://egoistheenemy.com/) takes on a new light: learning to communicate with your manager (or protector) parts rather than shaming or shutting them down can be an effective tool for navigating difficulty or high-expectation periods of life. This may not have been the takeaway Holiday had in mind for his readers, but it's certainly one I took from this title.
