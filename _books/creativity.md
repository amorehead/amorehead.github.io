If you want to take a deep dive on the psychology of some of the most creative individuals of our time, look no further than [Creativity](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/creativity-mihaly-csikszentmihalyi) by the venerable [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi). This book will teach you that creativity looks different for everyone, but focused effort (and flow) seems to be a key ingredient within many of history's most creative environments.
