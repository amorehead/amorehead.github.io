[Abundance](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Abundance/Ezra-Klein/9781668023488), as a recent book, offers a future-focused critique of modern political systems by acknowledging the past and present realities of everyday Americans. In other words, the authors present an optimistic vision of what the future may look like for all Americans if we are intentional with how we structure society's housing policies, immigration processes, and education opportunities. Relevant and generous to most political idealogies, Abundance describes how we might build a forward-seeking future without sacrificing our modern modalities of living and enjoying life.
