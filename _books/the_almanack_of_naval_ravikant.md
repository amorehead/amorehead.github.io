Inevitably, [Naval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Ravikant) would show up on one of my reading lists. [The Almanack of Naval Ravikant](https://www.navalmanack.com/) takes readers on a whirlwind yet holistic philosophical (and practical) exploration of what makes life worth living (and how to live well in the modern era). For those interested in lifestyle design, this is a must read.
