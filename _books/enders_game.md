[Ender's Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game) has been on my list of science fiction books to read for quite a while, and after reading it, I can say it offers a lot of psychological content to unpack. It finds its stride when it focuses on the relationship of Ender (the protagonist) to his siblings as well as his own thoughts (which start to sound like his siblings over time). If you are interested in this kind of character analysis, this work won't disappoint.
