[The Eden Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eden_Express) characterizes a gradual descent into insanity, courtesy of Mark Vonnegut, the son of the famous novelist Kurt Vonnegut. In this memoir, Mark offers readers a personal account of his experience with schizophrenia and the events leading up to it. What's more, he does so while connecting with his readers through his use of vivid imagery and a surreal style of humor. Even if you are just a tiny bit curious what his experience was like, this book will not disappoint.
