A perennial concept is the idea that our choice of words and the intention behind them matter. [Nonviolent communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication) (NVC) takes this a step further by urging us to see the wisdom in expressing our needs and observations in a nonjudgmental manner. Relationships can break down when individuals confuse their (concrete) observations of others for (judgmental) evaluations of their performance or behavior. NVC helps get us back on track by intentionally delineating between observations and evaluations in real conversations in real time.
