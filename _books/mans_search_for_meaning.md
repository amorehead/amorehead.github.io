As a world-renowned treatise on human suffering and resilence at its most extreme, Viktor Frankl's book [*Man's Search for Meaning*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27s_Search_for_Meaning) characterizes one's experience of an existential meaning crisis precisely. What does man have left if even his family and health is reduced to its core remnants? Where can meaning and motivation to continue life come from in those [*dark nights of the soul*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Night_of_the_Soul)? Frankl presents readers with a stark, realistic, and humbling portrayal of the human condition at its most basic, offering leasons in reflection for each new generation to come.
