Listening well and empathetically is a key skill necessary for human societies to flourish. However, most of us struggle to practice exceptional communication skills when life becomes stressful, disregulated, or unpredictable. [Supercommunicators](https://charlesduhigg.com/supercommunicators/) shares insight into how humans hear and want to be heard. One key idea from this book is that, no matter what, connection is essential to communication: if you can't connect with those around you, you likely won't be able to communicate well with them either.
