Jonathan Haidt's popular title [The Anxious Generation](https://www.anxiousgeneration.com/book) paints a bleak picture of what happens when we humans unwittingly rewire childhood norms for an entire generation of kids (i.e., Gen Z or iGen). Without mindful design behind our use of technology early on, Haidt shows how we begin building the basis of a society riddled with distrust and social isolation. Fortunately, Haidt offers many practical next steps for how to correct this social trend with intention-based social and technology engagement.
