Looking at your Google Calendar on a weekend and realizing how much you have going on the next week can be simultaneously exhilarating and exhausting. It turns out, in a post-[attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy) world, that constantly filling our calendars to the brim can not only burn out our adrenal glands (not really) but may also limit our levels of creativity throughout the week (more on this later). In [Free to Focus](https://freetofocusbook.com/), Michael Hyatt outlines this idea in depth while making the case for a more intentional structuring of one's week, with the primary goal being to shift as many of your weekly activities into a zone of "Desire" rather than "Drudgery". Doing so may not only improve your everyday experience at work but also increase your annual creative output.
