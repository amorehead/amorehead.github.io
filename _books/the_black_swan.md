Taleb's venerable [*The Black Swan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan:_The_Impact_of_the_Highly_Improbable) has captured the attention of many astute and experienced practitioners of probability, planning, and investing. More importantly, it's a charming yet chilling reminder of how blind we as a society are to rare (though technically probable) events. By default, we simply are not prepared for unexpected deviations from the "everyday norm", largely as a function of our wiring for homeostatis (understandly so). However, Taleb urges his readers to make themselves personally and professionally robust against "black swan" events by (*full stop*) not trying to predict them in the first place!
