Neil Postman's [Amusing Ourselves to Death](https://www.amazon.com/Amusing-Ourselves-Death-Discourse-Business/dp/014303653X) is a classic critique of television and its impact on public discourse. In it, he argues that the medium of television (translation: modern social media) has transformed serious discourse into entertainment, leading to a society more concerned with amusement than with critical thought.
