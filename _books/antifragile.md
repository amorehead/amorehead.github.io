Taleb's more recent book entry [*Antifragile*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile_(book)) discusses at length some of the lessons we can learn, among many other time periods, from the [Great Recession of 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession#:~:text=The%20Great%20Recession%20was%20a,to%20country%20(see%20map).) and how hubris and unfounded intellectual postulating led us to base many of the world's socioeconomic components on shaky statistical grounds. *Antifragile* encourages its readers to rethink how (and whether) we try to measure risk and reward in modern (increasingly unpredictable) times.
