In [The Fall of Hyperion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_of_Hyperion_(novel)), Dan Simmons demonstrates a mastery of world building and narrative structuring in only the second (and final) installment of a two-part sci-fi series. This entry in the Hyperion series capitalizes on the captivating world context Simmons established in the series' first installment by carefully exploring a multi-character narrative through its natural conclusion(s). Gripping and stunning, The Fall of Hyperion represents a milestone in sci-fi writing that true (e.g., AI) fans should engage.
