For the last 40 years, [*Acceptance and Commitment Therapy*](https://stevenchayes.com/books/) (ACT) has given rise to a new wave of psychotherapy. In this framework, [Steven C. Hayes](https://stevenchayes.com/) outlines actionable steps one can take to regain connection to themselves and their core values. Disintegration from one's core values - either by never unearthing them or by falling away from them - can often lead to dissatisfaction with the trajectory of one's personal and professional life. To address this, ACT emphasizes helping individuals accept and reintegrate with their core values through specific actions one can take in any season of life.
