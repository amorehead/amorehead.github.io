In the spirit of [Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman), [David Robson](https://davidrobson.me/) warns readers of the dangers of relying on *intellectual thinking* indiscriminately. As Robson explains in [*The Intelligence Trap*](https://davidrobson.me/books/the-intelligence-trap/), human minds are unconsciously prone to taking mental shortcuts and reverting to well-formed biases about how the world (or other people) work. Through countless startling examples of intellectual blindspots leading to social phenomena such as *meta-forgetfulness*, Robson cautions readers to reconsider the grounding of their well-formed views of how the world *really* works.
