[Richard P. Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) is arguably one of the most iconic scientists and educators of the last century, alongside towering intellectuals such as [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) and [Marie Curie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie). [*"What Do You Care What Other People Think?": Further Adventures of a Curious Character*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Do_You_Care_What_Other_People_Think%3F) chronicles Feynman's life journey from being born a *modestly inquisitive* boy in mid-20th century New York, falling in love with both science and his early lover, to becoming one of the world's highest regarded icons of modern physics. This tale spans the gambit from exploring the fragility of human communications and ego in large, bureaucratic enterprises to characterizing the value of scientific thinking in the modern era.
