Neil Postman's [Technopoly](https://www.amazon.com/Technopoly-Surrender-Technology-Neil-Postman/dp/0679745408) is a thought-provoking examination of how technology has come to dominate our culture. Postman argues that we have surrendered our autonomy to technology, allowing it to dictate the terms of our lives. He warns against the dangers of a society that prioritizes technological advancement over human values and ethics.
