Anthony De Mello's [Awareness](https://www.amazon.com/Awareness-Opportunities-Reality-Anthony-Mello/dp/0385249373) presents a series of lectures De Mello gave on the intersection of Buddhist, Hindu, and Christian mysticism. There are few works that manage to interpolate between these traditions with as much thoughtfulness as De Mello has.
