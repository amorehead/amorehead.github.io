Jared Diamond captured my attention for the better part of May 2025 with his illustrative book [Upheaval: Turning Points for Nations in Crisis](https://www.amazon.com/Upheaval-Turning-Points-Nations-Crisis/dp/0316409138). History presents several instances of moments in time where certain countries were threatened with challenges beyond their ability to cope (at that point in time). Some countries (for certain reasons) stagnated or declined as a result of such challenges, whereas others (for other reasons) improved their average quality of life as a result. In a time of unceasing polarization between groups of thought, Upheaval offers readers a chance to imagine how modern societies may rise to the challenges they are currently facing. As usual, in due time, we will see what social strategies promote adaptation and which accelerate decline.
