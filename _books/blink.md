How often do you rely on gut feelings to make important decisions in your life? After reading Malcolm Gladwell's [Blink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink:_The_Power_of_Thinking_Without_Thinking), you might think twice. This book argues for the importance of examining how potent pattern recognition can be for enacting both positive and negative events in society. Despite mixed reception by well-known human behavior researchers such as Daniel Kahneman, Blink offers readers an inquisitive look into the (surprising) world of human intuitions.
