In [The Coddling of the American Mind](https://www.thecoddling.com/), Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt sparked an ongoing societal conversation about the role of discourse and debate of ideas in higher education. The book highlights how, over the last decade, American colleges and universities have increasingly promoted a "fragile student" philosophy when organizing courses and discussions on campus. With an "antifragile student" philosophy, however, Lukianoff and Haidt argue that students will be better prepared to face the complexities of the modern world and future technological advancements, by equipping them with the skills necessary to mediate idealogical disagreements with composure and compassion.
