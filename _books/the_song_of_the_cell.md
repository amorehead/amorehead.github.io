[The Song of the Cell](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Song-of-the-Cell/Siddhartha-Mukherjee/9781982117368) reads much more like prose than scientific text, yet it contains nearly as much information as the latter (on the topic of cell biology and its role in our universe). In this book, Siddhartha Mukherjee outlines a compelling worldview of the singular becoming the basis for all the complexity we see in the world and how this rising complexity should inform how we think about human health and sustainability today (and in the near future).
