Charlie Hoehn and Tim Ferriss have written extensively on the topic of burnout and working for work's sake (WFWS), which is often a precondition to burnout. Charlie's book [Play It Away](https://www.amazon.com/Play-Away-Workaholics-Cure-Anxiety/dp/0615918174) offers readers poignant warning signs to watch for in the face of looming social, somatic, or psychological turmoil that often arises from WFWS. Environments shape habits, which in turn can make us more or less likely to care for our long-term needs such as strong social connections with others and a sense of purpose in one's life. In this book, Charlie shares several personal accounts of having to rebuild his personal and professional life with intentionality after "auto-piloting" through life following unsustainable work habits.
