In [*The Hero of Ages*](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/the-mistborn-saga-the-original-trilogy/), Sanderson concludes his epic Mistborn trilogy by exploring the classic "world end" fantasy trope in a refreshing light: What if the laws of nature themselves began to push towards obsolescence and indiscriminate destruction? How might that impact the psychology and motivations of the story's protagonists? The series finishes its narrative on a steely note yet in a manner that spurs its readers to consider how else the story might have evolved. As Sanderson writes through one of his final surviving characters (seemingly in reference to himself as the author), "Finally he exhaled softly, his work finished."
