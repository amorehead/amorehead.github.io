When [Nexus](https://www.ynharari.com/book/nexus/) came to my awareness, I knew I had to dive in, simply given Yuval Noah Harari's exceptional ability to synthesize complex historical topics into an accessible narrative for us all to engage with. AI enthusiasts (and those simply concerned with the future of humanity and its societies) should consider reading this book to wrestle with key questions Harari raises in it such as, "If we can't trust institutions (as flawed as they can be), what kind of societal structures are we left with?".
