[*The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*](https://www.franklincovey.com/the-7-habits/) has long been on my reading list and finally made its way to my earbuds (via an audio series). Stephen R. Covey certainly did a lot of research and "background study" living life before writing this book, because hard-won wisdom shines through many of its paragraphs. I personally think the live audio series version of this work is even easier to connect with than perhaps a traditional book version would be, since it features stories and examples from audience members' lives that help illustrate the basic principles introduced in this work.
