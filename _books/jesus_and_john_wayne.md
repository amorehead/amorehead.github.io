If you want to understand how (2010s and 2020s) American politics grew to its (staggering) level of polarization, a non-trivial part of the equation is understanding the history and trajectory of American Evangelicalism. [Jesus and John Wayne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_and_John_Wayne) offers, perhaps, the best account of this historical development, starting in the mid-20th century. A key takeaway of this book is that American Evangelicals have played a large role in shaping the values of the (American) Republican party and, as such, will likely have a say on how its future (political) values converge.
