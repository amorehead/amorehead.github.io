Inevitably, [Cal Newport's](https://calnewport.com/) well-known book [*So Good They Can't Ignore You*](https://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124) landed on my reading list this month (fortunately so). Cal's writing has a way of drawing from many relevant experiences modern knowledge workers will be familiar with, such as questioning the *right* way to build a fulfilling career in a world of endless possibilities. Succinct yet insightful, Cal's research presented in this work suggests that (1) chasing passion for its own sake often doesn't work well for shaping one's career and (2) as a consequence, most people are better off building *rare and valuable* skills (as defined by current or future market trends). By definition, such skills are *rare*, so without intentionality and [deliberate practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)#Deliberate_practice) one is unlikely to (serendipitously) cultivate them.
