I'm disappointed it took me this long to discover Joseph Campbell's work. [The Hero's Journey: Joseph Campbell on His Life and Work](https://www.jcf.org/product-page/the-hero-s-journey-joseph-campbell-on-his-life-and-work-ebook) paints a picture of a man enthralled in the literature of myths and stories, seeking to find commonalities between them as a way to unify human experiences and cultural themes. Although Campbell wasn't well known until the 1980s, since then, many popular figures in literature and storytelling today, such as George Lucas, have credited Campbell's writings with inspiring a new generation of artists and creatives to rediscover and reinterpret what a hero's journey should look like today.
