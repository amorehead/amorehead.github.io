Carol Dweck's book [Mindset](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322) sets the stage for understanding the difference between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset and how the latter can dramatically change the trajectory of one's life. There are few books built on as many research studies as this one, yet Dweck nonetheless succeeds at distilling their primary findings into relatable, real-life stories of how adopted mindsets have impacted individuals' lives.
