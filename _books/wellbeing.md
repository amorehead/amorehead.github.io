[Wellbeing](https://www.amazon.com/Wellbeing-Essential-Elements-Tom-Rath/dp/1595620400) by Tom Rath and Jim Harter provides a comprehensive look at the elements that contribute to one's overall wellbeing. The authors argue that wellbeing is not just the absence of illness but a holistic state that encompasses (1) career, (2) social, (3) financial, (4) physical, and (5) community wellbeing (in order of the magnitude of effect on one's overall wellbeing). Importantly, the authors provide practical strategies for enhancing wellbeing in our lives.
