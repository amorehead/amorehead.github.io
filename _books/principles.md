Ray Dalio's [Principles](https://www.principles.com/), now available in physical and audiobook formats, gives readers a chance to peek at the "operating system source code" of the hedge fund [Bridgewater](https://www.bridgewater.com/). In particular, this book details how its founders intentions of crafting a culture of radical transparency traded the common (comfortable) business practice of "saving face" by withholding one's true opinions of business decisions for the incredible financial and professional growth the fund has achieved over the last several decades. In short, operating a business from a culture of mutually-assured accountability is far from an easy task, but Bridgewater stands as a case study of the power of this approach to leadership in the world of business and beyond. Plus, it's easier to develop a familial-level of camaraderie when you can trust that others are being honest with you on any given day.
