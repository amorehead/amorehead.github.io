[The Way of Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_of_Kings) is a multi-part narrative about a medieval world empowered by (transformable) energy derived from stones and minerals. Several character arcs and developments combine in an enthralling manner to paint a picture of a world on the brink of political and geographic disaster. If you enjoy epic world-building novels, this one isn't one to miss.
